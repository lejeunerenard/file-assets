TODO:
 - "Duplicate assets (via ->include(...)" testing?
 - The interface is horrible, improve, improve, improve
 - Document the output_path scheme
 - Make the output_path scheme easier to declare
 - Incorporate *::Minifier::XS

0.060_1 Thursday June 05 18:48:02 PDT 2008:
 - Marked $asset->content_digest as deprecated
 - Changed the name of Filter->digest to Filter->key_digest
 - Added %.?, %-?, %/? to output_path scheming
 - Got rid of %a, and %b in output_path scheming, these are now %l, and %-l
 - The output_path now includes %-d by default (good in the case of filter-built assets)
 - Remove HAML reference (meant SASS anyway)
 - Added a note about YUI Compressor version compatability

 - Bump for packaging error (*grumble* *grumble* META.yaml inc/ *grumble*)

0.055 Saturday March 29 22:57:47 PDT 2008:
 - Fixed a problem with inline content being escaped by HTML::Declare (thanks James Munson)
 - ->include and ->include_content can now accept simple HTML of the form <script>script> or
   <style></style>
 - Will not detect for rank/type misordering in ->include, ->include_path, and ->include_content
   It should just do-the-right-thing now.

0.051 Tuesday March 11 21:28:07 PDT 2008:
 - Fixed issue where HTML::Declare was using self-closing <script/> HTML, which 
   most browsers don't like (thanks patspam):

0.050 Sunday March 02 00:29:57 PST 2008:
 - Major "guts" rewrite. The interface is largely the same,
   but some heavy lifting had to be done to support different text/css media types.
 - Inline content is supported via ->include_content(...) or ->include(content => ...)
 - Passes through unrecognized attributes when generating HTML
 - Filters and output path selection is handled in a somewhat better (though not perfect, IMHO)
   fashion. Still need to write the documentation for this part.
